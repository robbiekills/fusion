SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
This document is divided into two sections: The Scripting Guide and the Scripting Reference. The 
first section, the Scripting Guide, explains the scripting application programming interface (API) 
of Fusion called FusionScript. It can be accessed via Lua or the Python programming language. 
FusionScript can be utilized to automate repetitive or complex tasks, customize the application 
behavior, extend Fusion’s functionality, or exchange data with third-party applications. 
This guide contains information on how to get started, the differences of scripting languages, how 
the API is laid out to represent the application model, and how to deal with it in practice.
The second section, the Scripting Reference, assumes you have an understanding of the scripting 
concepts and the fundamentals of scripting from the first section. The Scripting Reference describes 
the common API, its objects, members, arguments and usage. 
In order to write custom tools or extend Fusion’s core functionality, refer to the C++ SDK or Fuse 
documentation. For regular customization and Macros, read the corresponding chapter in the 
Fusion User Guide.
Target Audience
This document is intended for developers, technical directors, and users knowledgeable in 
programming. It was by no means written to teach programming concepts and does not act as a 
reference for programming languages. Please refer to the documentation of the respective language 
as advised in the chapter “Scripting Languages.” However, when possible practical examples will 
be given and complete tutorials show the most common applications of FusionScript.
Requirements
In order to follow this guide, you will need to have a copy of Blackmagic Design Fusion 8 installed.
A few features only available in Fusion 8 Studio are highlighted, while every other sample will work 
with the regular version of Fusion 8. In order to utilize Python, the C-based version of Python needs 
to be installed as explained in detail in the chapter Scripting Languages.
The source code of both scripting languages needs to be stored as plain text, which can be written 
in any non-formatting text processor like Notepad or TextEdit. It is recommended to make use of a 
dedicated code editor to benefit from syntax highlighting and language-specific features.

Conventions
Important notes will be featured in text boxes like this:
Code is introduced in boxes with a monospaced font like this:
print(“Hello World from Fusion!”) -- Writes text to the console
Regular text may refer to code statements inline, which is also represented by a monospaced font, 
e.g., the statement ‘print’ in this sentence:
The statement print writes text to the console.
Most examples shown in the guide are only excerpts of the full source code and may not be able to 
work on their own. This helps to make the guide more readable. However, all passages marked as 
Tutorial will contain full source code.
Most code examples are shown in Lua. Inline statements show the Lua implementation of the 
particular statement; as with Lua, it is easier to identify properties and methods. In order to not 
mix up Lua tuples with Python tuples, the generic term collection is used to describe tuples, list, 
dictionaries, etc.
The code here is written for teaching purposes. Sometimes things that could be refactored into 
separate methods are written explicitly or in a non-optimized way. Please do not hesitate to add 
your own talent to the code after the fundamental concepts of the API are known.
For consistency reasons naming convention follows roughly the naming of the API (cameCase) for 
both Lua and Python. Feel free to adapt to PEP8 or your own convention instead.

SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
What is scripting? Scripting is interpreting the specific programming language—in theory—line 
by line or in the form of compiled bytecode as opposed to executing precompiled machine code 
directly. Without going too deep into implementation details, it can be concluded that due to its 
nature, a complex application like Fusion can act as host and provide access to its functionality 
through a dedicated scripting API. The scripting environment wraps the underlying API and is less 
likely to crash the whole application if third-party code is defective. Code can be changed on the fly 
without restarting the host application. Additionally, a garbage collector does most of the memory 
management in common scripting environments. All this results in slower evaluation compared 
to native compiled code, but the performance is still beyond what can be done by a user with 
the regular graphical user interface. The JustInTime (JIT) flavor of Lua that is utilized in Fusion is 
especially known to perform almost as fast as native code in many cases. 
Ultimately, scripting allows for any programmer to mix the language features and libraries of the 
scripting language with the functionality of the host application. This allows an integration of thirdparty data or applications.
Let’s examine practical uses of scripting within Fusion by example. Scripting in production may 
help with:
> Automation: For example, read all media files from a given folder, 
for each of these, load them into a composition, add a watermark, 
scale them, and render them to a specific location.
> Repetitive tasks: For example find all savers in a composition 
and set their state to pass-through.
> Maintaining conventions: For example making sure the paths of the savers always 
point at a specific location on the server, and follow a specific naming convention.
> Tasks prone to human error: For example, verify that certain settings 
are set before sending a composition to rendering.
> Extending core features in the application: For example, importing 
animation data from a third-party application.
> Behavior that needs customization for specific pipeline: For example, 
override what happens when certain events occur. It may enforce 
certain tools to show up when a specific tool was created.
> Communication with a third-party application: For example, not only 
exchange data but also share events. When a specific pipeline tool 
triggers to create a shot, create the corresponding composition.
These are just examples of common applications. Some scripts may require an interface in order to 
adapt its behavior to a particular need. This may be a configuration file or information derived from 
the applications state (maybe the current selected tool in the composition). But in many cases, a

graphical user interface with a custom dialog that shows all the possible options for the behavior is 
needed. The latter will be examined in detail in the Graphical User Interfaces chapter.
In Fusion, the scripting API called FusionScript gives access to the most required functionality from 
the application. In order to fully utilize FusionScript, a basic understanding of how Fusion works 
is needed. Once this model is known, it will be easier to travel through the Scripting Reference in 
order to find a needed functionality.
With FusionScript, almost any aspect of Fusion can be accessed and controlled, whether it be the 
composition and its tools, rendering, metadata, settings, and attributes or the interface.
As FusionScript is only an abstract API, it allows access via different scripting languages—most 
notably the Lua Programming Language, which is embedded in Fusion or, if installed separately, 
the Python Programming Language. Although these languages and their features differ greatly, the 
FusionScript access from both languages is very similar as it accesses the same API. Differences and 
limitations are explained in the following chapter.
Quick Start Tutorial
Without further ado, let’s jump right into a working example.
As proposed earlier, we will create a Lua script that will pass through all but the currently selected 
Saver. If no Saver is selected, then basically all Savers will be passed through. This is very handy 
when you have a huge composition but need to prerender only a specific saver.
First Steps
To start, we need to create a new script by accessing the Menu at Script->Edit->New …
In the FileDialog, store the script under the name Disable Unselected Savers.lua under the 
Script folder.
In composition scripts, the filename is used as label to execute the script from the menu. 
A meaningful name should be chosen.
By default, Fusion will open the default application if nothing else was set in the preferences. You 
can manually edit the script by invoking Script->Edit->Disable Unselected Savers.
11
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
In the text processor, write the following line:
print(“Hello World from Fusion!”)
Save the script and execute it with Script->Disable Unselected Savers.
Switch to the Console tab in the interface. If everything was set up correctly, the console will show 
the following text:
All standard output like print will be piped to the console.
The Real Script
Breaking down our intended script in steps the following functionality needs to be implemented:
1. Get and store the current selected tool, if it is a Saver.
2. Iterate through all Savers in the composition.
3. Set these to PassedThrough if they do not match our initial selection.
In Scripts that are executed directly within Fusion two variables are accessible by default:
fusion and composition. In order to save typing, you can also use the short form fu and comp.
As their names indicate with fusion, you gain access to the applications properties and methods, 
while composition represents anything in the composition.
As all the tasks in this particular script concern the Composition, all required methods are to be 
found in this object or its members. First of all:
comp:GetToolList(bool selected, string type = nil)
Note
Please note that you edit the script with the Script->Edit-> submenu but execute it directly 
under Script->Name of your script.
All scripts in the composition script folder will be listed here, including subfolders.
12
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Returns all tools in the composition, or only the selected ones if the argument is set to true. The 
type argument is optional. It can be used to filter only specific types of tools.
The tool itself is in fact an object of type Tool or Operator. As you can see, Fusion’s application 
model follows the object-oriented programming concept, which will be examined in detail in the 
following chapters.
A tool has various properties and methods. But what we are looking for is an Attribute.
The common attribute to read and write the PassThrough state of a tool is a boolean called TOOLB_
PassThrough.
Since in this case we will only be setting it, all we need is:
tools:SetAttrs( { TOOLB_PassThrough = True } )
Note that we pass in a tuple, hence the curly brackets, as we could pass in multiple attributes to be 
set at once.
With these two commands, we can accomplish all the tasks needed for this script.
Source File: 01 Disable Unselected Savers
comp:Lock()
local selectedSavers = comp:GetToolList(true, “Saver”)
local allSavers = comp:GetToolList(false, “Saver”)
for i, currentSaver in pairs(allSavers) do
local isSelected = false
for j, currentSelectedSaver in pairs(selectedSavers) do
 if(currentSaver == currentSelectedSaver) then
Note
Most of the objects in the Scripting API have a base class called Object. Objects may have 
common properties, one of them being the storage of Attributes. Attributes represent a 
serializable state of the tool beyond its actual Inputs.
13
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
 isSelected = true
 end
end
if isSelected == false then
 currentSaver:SetAttrs( { TOOLB_PassThrough = true } )
end
end
comp:Unlock()
The first and last statement have not been introduced yet. 
comp:Lock()
comp:Unlock()
Whenever the composition needs to change its objects or data, you should Lock the composition, 
and Unlock it at the end. This guarantees to prevent race conditions, unnecessary redraws but also 
suppresses Dialogs, e.g., when a Loader or Saver is added to the Flow.
The following two lines simply return a tuple of all selected Saver and all Savers respectively.
selectedSavers = comp:GetToolList(true, “Saver”)
allSavers = comp:GetToolList(false, “Saver”)
The first loop iterates over all Savers.
The next iteration over each selected Saver compares all the selectedSavers with the currentSaver 
of the iteration. Since all the selected Savers are also within the collection of allSavers, we can tell 
for sure if the currentSaver has been selected or not.
If it has not been selected, then we set the currentSaver to PassThrough, which is equivalent to 
setting the tool to PassThrough in the FlowView. 
At the end, we Unlock the composition as mentioned before.
Save the script. Switch to Fusion, create a bunch of Savers. Select few of them and run the script. All 
but the selected Savers should be set to PassThrough now.

SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Fusion has two scripting Languages to choose from: Lua and Python. Both access the same API 
through FusionScript so it is up to you which language to choose.
Scripting differs from other APIs available in Fusion. Namely Fuses, Lua scripted plugins that also 
may contain OpenCL kernels for GPU based evaluation. Fuses allow creation of tools and filters, a 
feature that was originally only possible through the C++ SDK. 
Scripting through FusionScript leaves us with two options:
Lua
The Lua programming language is known for its efficiency, speed, and small memory footprint. 
Therefore it has been used widely in science and video games.
Fusion ships with Lua 5.1, with some additional libraries build in:
> IUP - for Graphical user interfaces (compare the chapter Graphical User Interfaces)
> bmd.scriptlib - A library with common Fusion related helper functions 
Lua is a first class citizen in Fusion as it ships with the install. All preferences and compositions are 
stored in a Lua table. Fuses are written in Lua and Simple Expressions also consist of a subset of 
Lua. Additionally, Fusion uses the LuaJIT (JustInTime) flavour of Lua, which outperforms CPython. 
While in regular scripts this may not matter, it is one reason why Fuses can only be written in Lua.
For a complete reference of the language, see the Lua documentation at: http://www.lua.org/
manual/5.1/
Here is the difference of Lua and Python in a nutshell:
> Member properties are accessed with a dot . Methods are invoked with a colon:
For example:
print(comp.ActiveTool)
print(comp:GetToolList(true))
> Boolean types are lowercase in Lua (true, false)
> functions, loops and conditions etc. are closed with an end statement.
> Lua only knows one collection type called tuple. It can be 
used like a Python tuple, list, or dictionary.
> Fusion has a function buildin called dump() which can be seen as an extension to 
print(). It formats the output of tables to be more readable. In the console you 
may also start the line with == as short from for dump, e.g., ==comp:GetAttrs()
Scripting Languages
15
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Libraries
One of Lua’s benefits is its light weight; Lua does not come with a big standard library. Instead, 
libraries and Lua files can be added. Since the FusionScript Lua interpreter is a custom version of 
Lua not all native Lua libraries are guaranteed to work with fusion.
Python
Introduction to Python
Python has been adopted quickly for its efficient syntax and language features. Particularly 
in the Visual Effects industry, Python resembles a standard for scripting. Most post-production 
applications today make use of Python, which is especially beneficial if your goal is to streamline the 
production with scripting. Beyond VFX literally thousands of libraries offer Python bindings, making 
it possible to access a broad range of tools with a common language.
In order to work in FusionScript the official C-based implementation of Python, sometimes referred 
to as CPython, needs to be installed on your system as shown below.
Choice of Version
Python comes as Python version 2 or version 3. The latter was introduced to resolve core issues of 
Python, for the cost of backwards compatibility in syntax and features. Compare:
https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3
In Fusion, you have the choice to either use Python 2.7 or 3.3. Depending on your task, either use 
2.7 (widest range of applications supported) or 3.3 if your pipeline depends on it. 
At the time of writing, the recommended VFX reference platform suggests the latest Python 2.7 
version, so many facilities may depend on this version.
Documentation
Official documentation of python can be found here:
https://docs.python.org/2.7/
https://docs.python.org/3.3/

FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Installation
Windows
You need to have the latest Python 2.7 or Python 3.3 installed on your system in order to be usable 
with Fusion. To match Fusion it needs to be the 64 bit compile.
https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
During installation, the install option needs to be set to “Install for all users” as shown below:
This way the Python library is installed so that Fusion is able to pick it up during startup. Continue 
with the setup below.
Mac OS X
You need to have the latest Python 2.7 or Python 3.3 installed on your system in order to be usable 
with Fusion. To match Fusion it needs to be the 64 bit compile.
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/
17
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Setup
After the installation of Python, Fusion needs to be restarted.
As you could have both versions of Python installed, you need to specify the preferred version in 
your preferences.
Set the default Version for .py Files and default console at:
> File Preferences...->Global and Default Settings->Script->Default Python Version
Note
If you need to make sure that your script is run with either Python 2 or Python 3, you can set the 
file extension of the script to either .py2 or .py3, respectively.
Note this is a non-standard behavior and will only work within Fusion.
18
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Libraries
In contrast to Lua, Python comes with a complete standard library. As a quick overview, here is a list 
of important modules.
> os (os & file system access)
> shutil (file system access)
> glob (file system matching & listing)
> os.path (os independent path handling)
> sys (system access)
For a complete list refer to:
https://docs.python.org/2/library/ 
https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/
Additionally, you can install external libraries either manually or by the eco system accessible 
through pip or easyinstall. Some libraries that are useful with Fusion are:
> slpp (Lua data parser for python)
https://github.com/SirAnthony/slpp
This library makes it easy to parse Lua tables, which most of the data in Fusion consists of.
> Pillow (Python Imaging Library Fork)
Image manipulation framework
> Numpy
Mathematical framework
Differences with FusionScript
As already noted Fuses cannot be written in Python.
Also EventScripts, callback scripts for certain events are also only possible with Lua.
Since historically FusionScript was Lua only, some methods that return multiple statements have a 
special Table() suffix variant to return the proper table for use in Python.
As the Lua collection is a tuple, you will need to pass a dictionary to the API in many cases, even 
when it seems to be treated like a list.
So each Value needs to have a key in the order of the entry.
19
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
For example a list like:
l = [“a”, “b”, “c”] 
needs to map to a dictionary
d = {1: “a”, 2: “b”, 3:”c” }
Please note that Lua uses 1 as the first index key of its tuples, not 0. Python dictionaries do not have 
a particular order. Only the key indicates their order in this case.
Similarly, all Lua tuples result in dictionaries in Python that need to be parsed into Lists. If order does 
not matter, it can be simply done by:
l = d.values()
If order is important their values need to be sorted by their keys before conversion to a list. This can 
be achieved with a list comprehension:
l = [item[1] for item in sorted(d.items())]
Choice of Scripting Language
The following list compiles reasons for the use of one or the other language.
Pro Lua:
> Batteries included - No setup needed
> Therefore shared scripts will guarantee to work in Fusion without setup
> More features in Fusion
> Easier to parse Fusion Tables
> Lighter and faster
> Fusion is shipping with many scripts in Lua that can act as examples
Pro Python:
> Utilization of other Python scripts/apps in the pipeline
> Most major VFX apps use Python
> Allows external scripting for cross-app communication (Studio only)
20
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
> Strong standard library
> Higher usage & more third party libraries, scripts, and bindings
> Comes pre-installed in Linux & OSX
The recommendation should always be to stick with the one you know. It makes no sense to learn 
a completely new language in most cases if you are already familiar with either Lua or Python, 
especially when scripts and libraries exist that you can rely on.
If you are just starting with scripting, you should stick to Lua if all you care for is Fusion, and you want 
to make it possible for other artist to utilize your scripts without prior setup. Also the knowledge 
gained in scripting will be beneficial for writing custom Fuses.
If you are using other VFX applications that eventually also support Python this might be the better 
choice for Fusion as well. The choice can also depend on the standard libraries or a particular third 
party library. Research your required environment before making a choice will save you time in 
the long run.
Regardless Fusion with its FusionScript API will respect your choice.
Cross-Language Evaluation
Sometimes it is necessary or useful to call in from one language to the other to access certain 
features, e.g., you might want to access the Lua function dump from within Python.
With the console set to Py2 execute:
composition.Execute(“dump(comp:GetAttrs())”)
To execute the string as Python from within Lua use:
composition:Execute(“!Py: print(comp.GetAttrs())”)
To target a specific Python version use !Py2: or !Py3:
You may also want to run complete Lua or Python scripts. Use:
composition:RunScript(filePath)
21
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Use either .lua, .py, .py2 or .py3 as file extension for the corresponding interpreter. Similar to the 
script menu, .py will execute in the Python interpreter that is installed and set in the preferences. 
As RunScript is also available in Python you may run .lua scripts from within Python.
Please note that it is not possible to pass return objects from one language to the other.
Note
The shown scripts are executed in the context of the currently open composition. 
Hence, all the evaluation methods are members of the composition object.
composition:Execute(command)
composition:RunScript(filePath)
If you want to execute the scripts in the context of the application, use fusion instead.
fusion:Execute(command)
fusion:RunScript(filePath)
22
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Console
Fusion has a console build-in that outputs print statements in scripts. This is useful for scripts without 
a GUI, or as tool for simple debugging.
For example:
> Lua
print(“Hello World.”)
> Python
print(“Hello World.”)
print “Hello World.” # This only works with Python 2.x
In all cases, the console will show “Hello World.” If executed from the console, the command will 
be mirrored in the console preceding the interpreter: Lua>, Py2> or Py3>
When used with a collection, print will only output the reference to the collection. To display its 
content in a preformatted way, use:
> Lua
dump(comp:GetAttrs())
The same can be achieved in Python with a module called “Data pretty printer” (pprint).
> Python
from pprint import pprint # Needs to be loaded once
pprint(comp.GetAttrs())
Please note that all the collections coming from FusionScript are essentially Lua tuples. Compare to 
the chapter Scripting Languages.
Tip
If used in the console, FusionScript offers a short form of dump for Lua and Python:
==comp:GetAttrs() -- Same as the command above
Scripting and Debugging
23
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Fusion supports different types of scripts based on the context, e.g., you might have a script that 
makes changes to the composition, while another script might only act on a certain tool.
Some of these contexts supply different sets of predefined objects. Like a Tool script will expose 
the tool it has been applied on as variable.
For better understanding, let us examine important script-contexts:
Interactive Scripts
Interactive scripts are all scripts within Fusion that require a user interaction to run. Most of these 
scripts are invoked by the user from the menu. 
The contexts available are:
Composition Script
Compositing scripts are the most common type of scripts. They are stored inside the Scripts:/
Comp folder and run from the Scripts Menu. As their name implies their intended context is the 
Composition. Therefore, access to the fusion and the composition object is given. Nothing stops 
you from implementing functionality that acts on a single selected tool within a Composition script, 
but you should consider using a tool script instead. The Menu understands subfolders, so when a 
script is placed inside a subfolder, a submenu for that folder will be created.
Tool Script
Tool scripts act on a single tool. They are stored inside the Scripts:/Tool folder and are accessible 
and editable from the right-click context menu of the tool’s properties. When invoked, the fusion, 
composition, and particular tool objects are available as variable.
Bin Script
Bin scripts are special scripts that act on the contents of a bin. They are stored inside the Scripts:/
Bin folder and are invoked through the context menu of the bin.
For more information about bins, refer to the Fusion User Manual.
Types of Scripts
24
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Utility Script
Utility scripts are those that act on Fusion itself, rather than on a particular Composition. They are 
stored inside the Scripts:/Utility folder and can be accessed through the File > Script Menu. The 
fusion variable is available by default.
Script Libraries
A scriptlib is a file containing a library of functions that can be used in multiple scripts. Included 
with the default installation of Fusion is the bmd.scriptlib, which contains common useful functions. 
The scriptlib could have additions in it such as variable declarations (added to the globals table, 
for instance). Script Libraries are installed in the root of the scripts directory (by default Scripts: ). In 
that directory, anything with a .scriptlib extension will be run whenever Fusion is started. In order 
to execute a scriptlib when a composition is created or opened, put the scriptlib in the Scripts:/
Comp folder instead. The added benefit of the scriptlib is that you can instruct Fusion to run a set 
of code every time a composition is created or opened. The downside to this is that Fusion will 
execute the files in the scripts directory in an arbitrary order. This means that any code you write in 
the script libraries that is reliant upon other libraries may not work. To get around this, try inserting 
the functions that are needed at the top of the scriptlib.
Beyond passing functions into the global environment of the composition, the scriptlib also can be 
set up to perform default actions on a composition. It can also be used to create custom events set 
up in event suites.
External Scripts
External scripts are run from outside of Fusion but can still access the Fusion instance.
Commandline Scripts
In the install directory of Fusion an application called FuScript is available, which allows to run scripts 
directly from the command line.
The mac version is to be found inside the app bundle at Fusion.app/Contents/MacOS/fuscript.
FuScript can execute a .lua script file directly:
FuScript <script> [args]
The passed args can be accessed by the script via arg[1], arg[2] … arg[n], while arg[0] is reserved to 
point at the path of the script being executed.
FuScript also has an interactive shell which can be started with:
FuScript -i
25
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
For other uses of FuScript run it without any argument. A list of possible arguments will be printed 
to the console.
To connect FuScript to a running instance of Fusion use the following snippet:
fusion = Fusion()
fu = fusion
composition = fu.CurrentComp
comp = composition
SetActiveComp(comp)
From now on, the interactive shell will act like the build in shell in Fusion. By calling 
SetActiveComp(comp), the global scope will accept calls to the composition. For example, the 
creation of tools like this:
blur = Blur()
This command will create a blur tool on the FlowView of the current open composition.
To run python version 2 or 3 you can specify the language like this:
FuScript <script> [args] -l python2
FuScript <script> [args] -l python3
Events & Callbacks
Events and callbacks get triggered when a certain event has occurred. A predefined callback will 
be invoked.
Event Suites
Event suites are installed as callbacks to certain events in Fusion. Install them like a regular scriptlib. 
Inside the scriptlib, add the following variable:
ev = AddEventSuite(“Composition”)
This variable has now access to events that occur when certain events are triggered.
26
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Possible events are:
> OnOpen() -- Triggers every time a file is opened
> OnSave() -- Triggers every time a comp is saved
> OnSaveAs() -- Whenever save as is called
> OnStartRender() -- Whenever a render starts
> OnEndRender() -- Whenever a render ends
> OnFrameRendered() -- Whenever a frame is rendered
> OnTimeChange() -- Whenever the time changes
> OnActivateTool() -- Whenever a tool is made active
For example: Create a file called PrintSaverPathsOnRender.scriptlib in the Scripts:/Comp folder. 
Enter the following content:
globals.ev = AddEventSuite(“Composition”)
function ev:OnStartRender(event)
 local toollist=comp:GetToolList(“Saver”)
 for i, tool in pairs(toollist) do
 print(tool:GetInput(“Clip”))
 end
 self:Default(event)
end
Now start a render with a composition that has at least one Saver with a valid path defined. The 
console will print all the paths of the Savers. Although this sample does not add much value, it could 
easily be modified to check and manipulate the paths.
Note
Always use self:Default(event) to call the base implementation of the event.
This will allow you to create multiple events with different scriptlibs.
27
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Removing an event suite is accomplished by running the RemoveEventSuite(suite) function. In the 
example scenario, the syntax would be:
RemoveEventSuite(ev)
Button Callbacks
Button callbacks are invoked when custom Button Controls within a tool are clicked.
Internally, the Attribute called BTNCS_Execute needs to be set. The easiest way to accomplish this 
is by using the UserControls ToolScript. When adding a Button control, a field labeled Execute can 
be used to call Lua commands.
The generated button control will end up in the composition as:
UserControls = ordered() {
 PrintHello = {
 LINKID_DataType = “Number”,
 INP_Default = 0,
 BTNCS_Execute = “print(\”Hello\”)”,
 LINKS_Name = “Print Hello”,
 INPID_InputControl = “ButtonControl”,
 },
 },
28
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
When clicked “Hello” will be printed in the console.
Hotkey Script
Hotkey scripts are scripts that can be attached to keyboard shortcuts in a particular context.
By default they are stored in a file called Fusion.hotkeys in the Profile: folder.
InTool Scripts
InTool scripts are special scripts that run on the tool during evaluation of each frame, at the start of 
the render or at the end. They are defined directly within the tool and have read access to a limited 
set of data through the input’s name—self, composition or comp, and fusion or fu. The limitation is 
supposed to prevent infinite loops, race conditions, and performance problems.
For example, you cannot call or change Inputs. If you want change Inputs based on a logic, use 
modifiers, expressions, or simple expressions. Also note that changing most of the Inputs in a tool 
will trigger a re-rendering and therefore the InTool Frame Render Script is evaluated again.
29
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Simple Expressions
Simple Expressions are a limited subset of the scripting environment directly within each Input of a 
tool. They can be used as replacements for the expression modifier, to directly connect and change 
incoming Inputs based on calculations.
Fuses
Fuses are Lua scripted plugins that act as regular Tool. They may be multithreaded and contain 
OpenCL kernels to process on the GPU. Refer to the dedicated Fuses documentation and reference.

SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
For a better understanding of FusionScript, it is worth looking under the hood of Fusion’s object 
model. Although FusionScript and the following overview is a great simplification of the real 
application, it will help us to navigate around the application within the scripting API.
Overview
Fusion is composed of different objects with individual types. One possible object type is an 
Operator, also known as Tool. Each Operator might have a couple of Links, being Input or Output 
objects, that may be represented in GUI inside the properties view. The reference to the Composition 
is also a special object type, as is is Fusion itself. Even FileTypes, which represent file formats that 
can be read by a Loader, are objects.
Most objects contain a set of Attributes that represent the state of the object and it capabilities. 
Additionally they may contain Data, a special form of metadata.
Each object must be registered in an internal registry with its particular type and function. This 
way information about every object or tool can be read from the registry before an instance has 
been created.
While we do can access most of the information from the registry, FusionScript deals most of the 
time with the instances in the Application, Composition, Tool, Inputs etc.
Common Object Dependencies
This chapter pictures the common object dependencies in Fusion. This means that the users 
experiences the relations of objects similar to these dependencies, while the underlying 
implementation and exposed object hierarchy may look different.
This is only an excerpt of the most common objects a user is likely to use and may help to picture 
the interaction with Fusion from a user’s point of view:
Fusion
> Composition (collection)
> Tool (collection)
> Inputs (collection)
Some being MainInputs = Input connections on the FlowView
> Type: Sets and gets type
Text
Number
Image

> Outputs (collection)
Some being MainOutputs = Output connections on the FlowView
> Type: Sets and gets type
Text
Number
Image
Data3D
other
While this view is highly simplified and neglects many aspects and features of the interface—like 
LUT, Viewers etc.—it is at the core the data that a user deals with most of the time.
Fusion Instance
The starting point for all access is a Fusion object. A Fusion object represents a running Fusion 
instance. It can create, open, and close compositions, stores application wide settings and 
preferences or persistent metadata. Fusion is able to open and manage multiple compositions from 
one Fusion instance. The graphical user interface represents these with a Tab-Layout. In scripting 
all currently loaded compositions are accessible with fu:GetCompList(). The currently active 
Composition can be accessed via fu.CurrentComp or fu:GetCurrentComp(). To load a composition 
use fu:LoadComp(path, locked) or create an empty composition using fu:NewComp(locked, 
auto-close, hidden). You can also quit the Fusion instance by using fu:Quit(). If you are running 
the script from within Fusion it still will be executed. In reality the script is not bound to the Fusion 
instance. Instead a FuScript application is spawned that evaluates the scripts and communicates 
to the running Fusion instance. If your script exits, eventually the FuScript instance will also be 
stopped. This obviously also applies if running scripts from an external scripting environment as 
explained in the earlier chapter.
Composition Instance
A Composition may also store settings, attributes, and persistent metadata. While the Fusion 
instance holds Global Settings, each composition may have an individual set of settings. This 
behaviour is mimicked in the preferences dialog, where either global settings for each new 
composition, or individual settings of currently opened compositions can be changed. Most of 
the time the composition settings should be accessed to include the overrides for the current 
composition. This includes the PathMapping, which is used to identify paths from Fusion’s relative 
path system.
The composition can be Saved and Closed, create Undos, Undo actions, and Redo them and Clear 
Undos altogether. Also, playback and rendering can be invoked from a composition.
32
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Please note that you can comp:Lock() a composition, which prevents re-rendering due to changes 
and dialog pop-ups until the composition is unlocked again with comp:Unlock(). Use locking 
whenever possible if you manipulate the composition. You can query the lock state of a composition 
via comp:IsLocked().
Tools on the composition can be queried. A composition can get and set the currently active tool 
via comp.ActiveTool and comp:SetActiveTool(tool). All tools within the composition are queried 
with comp:GetToolList() while only the selected tools a queried with comp:GetToolList(true).
 Selection of tools is part of the FlowView and can be triggered like this:
flow = comp.CurrentFrame.FlowView
flow:Select(Blur1, true) -- Adds blur1 to the selection
flow:Select(Blur2, false) -- Removes blur2 from the selection
flow:Select() -- Deselects all
Both composition and fusion have GetPrefs() and SetPrefs(), which store the preferences of 
Fusion and the local copy of the composition. If you cannot find a particular setting in there, take a 
look inside the Attributes as described later on.
Note
Fusion tools can have three selection states: unselected, selected and active & selected .
While the selected tools are the ones drag-selected (indicated by a blue color), the active tool is 
the last clicked tool (indicated by a yellow color). Still, an active tool is also automatically selected.
This behaviors enables a finer selection, e.g., when you want to copy one tool’s settings to other 
tools, you can drag select all the target tools and then activate the source tool by clicking on it.
33
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Tool Instances
Tools are uniquely named operators of a particular type. Internally a tool is a subset of an Operator 
that is visible on the flow. It can be a Creator or Filter, 3D Tool, etc. Another example of Operator is 
a Modifier. It is a like a Tool but deals with Number or Text data instead of Image data. Still you can 
connect it to Inputs and other Modifiers.
For simplicity, we will talk about Tools most of the time while the techniques may also apply to 
different Operator types.
Read access to the name and its type is given with tool.Name and tool.ID. For read and write 
access of the name, use the attribute called TOOLS_Name. Note that the attribute TOOLB_NameSet 
indicates if the name was manually changed. If not, some tools will show additional information on 
the tile next to its name. For example, the loader will show the clip’s filename.
Other important attributes are its PassThrough-State with TOOLB_PassThrough and Lock-State with 
TOOLB_Locked.
Similar to the selection state the position of the tool on the FlowView is not part of the tool instance 
but of the flow.
flow = comp.CurrentFrame.FlowView
==flow:GetPos(Blur1) -- prints the position of Blur1
==flow:SetPos(Blur1, 5, 1) -- sets the position of Blur1 to x = 5 y = 1
If many tools are repositioned, the shown method will be slow. You can queue re-positioning of 
multiple tools and apply it in one batch like this:
-- Repositions all tools in a column
flow = comp.CurrentFrame.FlowView
flow:QueueSetPos()
for i, tool in ipairs(comp:GetToolList()) do
flow:QueueSetPos(tool, 0, i)
end
flow:FlushSetPosQueue()
Tools have Inputs and Outputs that are discussed in detail next.
34
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
MainInputs and MainOutputs
In general, tools have Inputs and Outputs. Property Inputs—being represented by controls in 
the properties view (e.g. the Gain slider in a ColorCorrector)—or the Inputs on the flow view that 
connect one tool to the other, so called MainInputs. Outputs are very similar although most of the 
time tools only have one MainOutput on the FlowView. An exception being the Stereo Splitter 
(Fusion Studio) as shown in the figure.
The distinction if an Input or Output is on the flow is made by defining them as MainInput and 
MainOutput during the development of the Plugin or Fuse.
Visible MainInputs can be queried by using tool:FindMainInput(i), while MainOutputs are 
available with tool:FindMainOutput(i). As there can be more than one MainInput or MainOutput, 
these methods require an argument i starting with 1.
If there is no result for the given index, the method returns nil. The following snippet shows how to 
query all MainInputs and MainOutputs of the active tool:
tool = comp.ActiveTool
if(tool ~= nil) then
print (tool.Name)
local i = 1
while(true) do
 out = (tool:FindMainInput(i))
 if out == nil then break end
35
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
 print(string.format(“\tMainInput %d: %s”, i, out.Name))
 i = i + 1
end
i = 1
while(true) do
 out = (tool:FindMainOutput(i))
 if out == nil then break end
 print(string.format(“\tMainOutput %d: %s”, i, out.Name))
 i = i + 1
end
end
Inputs and Outputs
Next to the MainInput and MainOutputs there are other Inputs and Outputs. If Inputs are not hidden 
they can be represented as an Input control in the properties view. Still the underlying DataType 
might be the same. For example a Number DataType might be accessible through a slider control, 
a Checkbox, a DropdownList, a Multibutton etc.
To query the underlying DataType of an Input, use inp:GetAttrs(“INPS_DataType”).
To query the underlying DataType of an Output use outp:GetAttrs(“OUTS_DataType”).
A control allows users to change the corresponding value of the underlying DataType in the 
properties view. An optional preview control allows to change the value directly in the Viewer.
In scripting the value on an Input can be changed directly with an assignment, by using an index 
that represents a specific time or by using tool:SetInput(“InputName”, value, [time]).
Specifying the time only makes sense the input is animated as shown later. Only simple DataTypes 
like integers, float, and strings are supported.
36
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Consider the following example:
Merge1.Angle = 10 -- Sets Angle to 10
Merge1.Angle[5] = 20 -- Sets Angle to 20 on frame 5
Merge1:SetInput(“Angle”, 20, 5) -- Same as above
To get a value of a given Input use:
print(Merge1.Angle) -- Gets the Angle input handle
print(Merge1.Angle[TIME_UNDEFINED]) -- Gets the Angle value
print(Merge1.Angle[5]) -- Gets Angle on frame 5
Merge1:GetInput(“Angle”, 5) -- Same as above
Please note that you cannot use Merge1.Angle to retrieve a value as this will return the Input handle.
Querying Inputs
Like MainInputs on the Flow, Inputs can be connected to other Outputs like Published Inputs, 
Animated Inputs, or Modifiers. Although not represented with a FlowView, a similar connection flow 
is possible with all Inputs. The main difference being that MainInputs deal with Image data, Masks, 
Data3D, Particle Streams while regular Inputs deal with Numbers, Points, and Text etc.
All Inputs, regardless of being MainInputs or not can be listed via tool:GetInputList(). All Outputs 
can be listed with tool:GetOutpuList(). In both cases, an optional filter of the DataType can be 
specified. Additionally if the name is known the Input and Output can be accessed directly as 
property of the tool. If you mouse hover over an Input, the status bar will show the name. E.g. to 
access the Gain Input of a BrightnessContrast tool use: BrightnessContrast1.Gain
Connections
An Input can be connected to an Output via the inp:ConnectTo(output) method. It can be disconnected 
via inp:ConnectTo(). To get the connected output of an Input use inp:GetConnectedOutput(). 
Similarly you can get all connected Inputs of an Output with outp:GetConnectedOutputs(). Please 
note the plural form of the latter command.
37
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Please note that both Output and Input share the same parent class called Link, which allows them 
to access GetTool() to refer to the Tool containing the Input or Output.
Inputs can be connected directly to their underlying DataType but they can also be connected to 
other inputs of the same DataType, a modifier or animation. As all of this internally is implemented 
as connection, once the upstream Input needs to be evaluated, all of it connected downstream 
outputs get queried. This allows for a complex connection scheme with many cross dependencies.
Animation
To animate an Input via script, the first step is to add a BezierSpline. A Bezier Spline is an animation 
curve that can be viewed in the spline editor. It is a storehouse for the information contained in the 
animated properties of a tool. To do this for a Merge’s blend property, the following code could 
be employed:
Merge1.Blend = BezierSpline({})
By setting the input’s value at a specific time, keyframes will be created.
Note
By design, one Output might be connected to multiple Inputs, but one Input can only have one 
incoming Output connection.
38
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
If the property is a Point DataType, use the Path{} function instead to add a bezier-based path.
If the desire was to then animate the blend from 1 to 0 over the period of 100 frames, one could use 
the following code: 
Merge1.Blend[1] = 1
Merge1.Blend[100] = 0
You can request a collection of all keyframes on a BezierSpline:
local spline, splineout, splinedata
-- gets the spline output that is connected to the Blend input,
splineout = Merge1.Blend:GetConnectedOutput()
-- then uses GetTool() to get the Bezier Spline modifier itself, and 
if splineout then
 spline = splineout:GetTool()
 -- then uses GetKeyFrames() to get a table of a spline data. This
 splinedata = spline:GetKeyFrames()
 -- data is then dumped.
 dump(splinedata)
end
The data returned consists of a nested table, one for each keyframe and with a key value of the 
keyframe’s time. The subtables contain an entry for the keyframe’s value, and optionally, subtables 
for the left and/or right handles, called “LH” and “RH.” The handle subtables contain two entries, 
for the handle’s X & Y position.
To remove key frames from an animated spline, set the value to nil.
Merge1.Blend[composition.CurrentTime] = nil
39
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
In the above case, the key frame was removed from the comp’s current frame. However, if that key 
frame was the only point on an animation spline, the point would not be deleted, as splines must 
have at least one point at all times. 
The animation can be deleted completely, reverting the Input to a static value.
Instead of specifying the time set the whole Input to nil.
Merge1.Blend = nil
Attributes
Attributes store information about the capabilities of a certain type, as well as some common flags 
that contribute to the object’s state.
For example, in the case of a Tool the attributes may include the typename of the object, its name 
in the composition, its abbreviation shown in the Toolbar, its PassThrough and selection state, etc.
Attributes have read access but it is not guaranteed that you can change all Attributes. So while it is 
possible to change the PassThrough-State of a tool, it makes no sense to change its type.
Each Operator Type will have a different set of Attributes depending on its type. You cannot add 
your own Attributes. Instead, use a mechanism like Image stream metadata or Object Data.
In order to access the Attributes, the GetAttrs() method can be used. As it is provided by the 
Object superclass, pretty much all objects can have Attributes. So GetAttrs() is a good place to 
look for functionality or data within an object. 
If no argument is given, all Attributes are returned. It is also possible to supply a single tag string to 
narrow down the search.
==Merge1:GetAttrs() -- dump all Tool Attributes
==Merge1.Blend:GetAttrs() -- Inputs also have attributes
==Merge1:GetAttrs(“TOOLB_Locked”) -- Only show the Locked status
The tags consist of a Type prefix, a character for the type, an underline and the Name of 
the Attribute. So for example most Attributes within a Tool have a TOOL prefix, Inputs INP, 
Compositions COMP etc.
40
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
The type character stands for:
S String
B Boolean
N Number (float)
I Integer
H Handle
NT Number Table
IT Integer Table
ST String Table
BT Boolean Table
In our example, TOOLB_Locked stands for a Tool Attribute of type boolean with the name “Locked.”
Attributes can be changed by using SetAttrs({}). The supplied table is required to have the Tag 
as key and the new value as value. Multiple attributes can be changed at a time, however not all 
Attributes can be changed at all. The following example renames “Merge1” to “MyMerge” and locks 
the tool in one call:
Merge1:SetAttrs({TOOLS_Name = “MyMerge”, TOOLB_Locked = true})
Object Data
Data is a special type of Metadata that is stored within the application preferences or composition.
As opposed to Metadata that is read from an image data stream (e.g., OpenEXR) and is passed 
from tool to tool, the Object Data is not passed with the data stream. Instead, it is consistent for the 
current state of the application, composition, or tool.
This makes it a perfect candidate for reliably storing states of custom scripts with the composition.
For example, let’s say a custom script with a GUI needs to store its last used path so that the user 
does not have to change the path each time the script is being used.
41
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
One option is to create a global variable and check if it is set on each run:
if globals.mytool_lastpath then
 path = mytool_lastpath
else
 path = “default/path”
end
-- ... Dialog with the path
globals.mytool_lastpath = path
However, once Fusion is closed the variable is gone. This strategy only makes sense for data that is 
not likely to change from session to session, like a cached list of currently loaded Tools.
But for our scenario, it may be wiser to store each latest path with the fusion preferences so that each 
new composition can reference the last used path, even when Fusion is closed and reopened.
local last_path = fusion:GetData(“mytool.lastpath”)
if last_path then
 path = last_path
else
 path = “default/path”
end
-- ... Dialog with the path
fusion:SetData(“mytool.lastpath”, path)
However, another strategy might be to store the data with the composition, so each composition 
can have its own path. Simply replace fusion with composition or any other context that makes 
sense if your case.
42
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Please note that the dot notation is not random. Dots represent a subtable. So you can put multiple 
variables or even other nested tables inside of “mytool.” Use this to your advantage, e.g., to 
define a domain wide root name that represents your studio, a sub table with the tools and their 
individual settings:
fusion:SetData(“MyStudioInc.MyCompTool.DoMagic”, true)
fusion:SetData(“MyStudioInc.MyRenderSettings.RemoteNames”, “clients”)
...
Where is the actual ObjectData stored?
In the case of the fusion you will find the data in the Fusion8.prefs, at Global.Script.GlobalData.
With Compositions, tools etc. the ObjectData is stored with the respective object in the Composition 
file. As all these are Lua-Tables, go ahead and open the .comp file with a text processor. You should 
find the Object data you specified.
Metadata
ObjectData is easily confused with regular Image Metadata. However, Image Metadata can only 
be read with scripts, but not changed, as it is tied to the Image Stream itself. You will need Fuses or 
Plugins to change the Image Stream and its Metadata directly. In order to access it, you will need to 
evaluate the Output up to the point where the Metadata was queried.
This is not needed in the case of ObjectData, as it depends on the Object instance and not on its 
underlying data stream.
In a Loader with a valid input access is Metadata like this:
==Loader1.Output[comp.CurrentTime].Metadata.Filename
In SimpleExpression, the evaluation is not needed, as it is automatically evaluated at the current 
time. For example put this in a text field’s Expression field:
Loader1.Output.Metadata.Filename
Note
A big benefit of Tool ObjectData is that it is stored directly within the Tool. It will be passed on 
if the tool is copied and pasted into another composition. However, a newly created tool will 
not have any ObjectData, so make sure to catch this default case by an EventSuite or similar.
43
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Although scripts can run in the background and output text to the Console often a graphical user 
interface is required. This way the logic of a script can be changed based on options set by the user. 
There are two options. For more complex user interfaces, Lua ships with the iup GUI library. Please 
refer to the documentation of the library, as its usage is beyond the scope of this document:
http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/
The other option is a build-in dialog called AskUser.
Ask User
A simple way to build and evaluate a dialog is called: comp:AskUser(name, {table of inputs}).
Each input is a table structured as follows :
{Input Name, Input Type, Options ...}
Input Name (string, required)
This name is the index value for the controls value as set by the user (i.e., dialog.Control or 
dialog[“Control Name”]). It is also the label shown next to the control in the dialog, unless the 
Name option is also provided for the control.
Input Type (string, required)
A string value describing the type of control to display. Valid strings are FileBrowse,PathBrowse, 
Position, Slider, Screw, Checkbox, Dropdown, and Text. Each Input type has its own properties and 
optional values.
Options (misc)
Different control types accept different options that determine how that control appears and 
behaves in the dialog.
All script execution stops until the user responds to the dialog by selecting OK or Cancel. 
The returned table contains the responses from the user, or nil if the user canceled the dialog.
Note
This function can only be called interactively, command line scripts cannot use this function.
Graphical User Interfaces
44
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
For example, if you wanted to display a dialog that requested a path from a user, you might use the 
following script:
ret = composition:AskUser(“A Sample Dialog”, { {“Select a Directory”, “PathBrowse”} } )
dump(ret)
Several of the Options are common to several controls. For example, the name option can be 
used with any type of control, and the DisplayedPrecision option can be used with any control that 
displays and returns numeric values. The commonly used options for controls are:
> Name (string)
This option can be used to specify a more reasonable name for this inputs 
index in the returned table than the one used as a label for the control.
> Default (string)
The default value displayed when the control is first shown.
> Min (integer)
Sets the minimum value allowed by the slider or screw control.
> Max (numeric)
Sets the maximum value allowed by the slider or screw control.
> DisplayedPrecision (numeric)
Use this option to set how much precision is used for numeric controls 
like sliders, screws and position controls. A value of 2 would allow 
two decimal places of precision - i.e., 2.10 instead of 2.105
> Integer (boolean)
If true the slider or screw control will only allow integer (non decimal) values, 
otherwise the slider will provide full precision. Defaults to false if not specified.
45
SCRIPTING GUIDE 1
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Control Types
The following table indicate types of control.
Text Displays the Fusion textedit 
control, which is used to enter 
large amounts of text into 
a control.
Linear (integer)
A number specifying how many lines of text to 
display in the control.
Wrap (boolean)
A true or false value that determines whether the 
text entered into the control will wrap to the next 
line when it reaches the end of the line.
ReadOnly (boolean)
If this option is set to true, the control will not allow 
any editing of the text within the control. Used for 
displaying non-editable information.
FontName (string)
The name of a truetype font to use when 
displaying text in this control.
FontSize (numeric)
A number specifying the font size used to display 
the text in this control.
FileBrowse
PathBrowse
ClipBrowse
The FileBrowse input allows 
you to browse to select a file 
on disk, while the PathBrowse 
input allows you to select a 
directory. ClipBrowse is used 
to get sequences with their 
appropriate filters.
Save (boolean)
Set this option to true if the dialog is used to select 
a path or file which does not yet exist (i.e.when 
selecting a filae to save to)
Slider Displays a standard Fusion slider 
control. Labels can be set for the 
high and low ends of the slider 
using the following options.
LowName (string)
The text label used for the low (left) 
end of the slider.
HighName (string)
The text label used for the high (right) end of 
the slider.
Checkbox Displays a standard Fusion 
checkbox control. You can 
display several of these controls, 
next to each other using the 
NumAcross option
Default (numeric)
The default state of the checkbox, use 0 to leave 
the checkbox deselected, or 1 to enabled the 
checkbox. Defaults to 0 if not specified.
NumAcross (numeric)
If the NumAcross value is set, the dialog will 
reserve space to display two or more checkboxes 
next to each other. The NumAcross value must be 
set for all checkboxes to be displayed on the same 
row. See examples below for more information.

FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Position Displays a pair of edit boxes 
used to enter X & Y coordinates 
for a center control or other 
position value. The default value 
of this control is a table with two 
values, one for the X value and 
one for the Y. The control returns 
a table of values.
Default (table {x,y})
A table with two numeric entries specifying the 
value for the x and y coordinates.
Screw Displays the standard Fusion 
thumbnail or screw control. This 
control is almost identical to 
a slider in almost all respects 
except that its range is infinite, 
and so it is well suited for 
angle controls and other values 
without practical limits.
Dropdown Displays the standard Fusion 
drop down menu for selecting 
from a list of options. This 
control exposes and option call 
Options, which takes a table 
containing the values for the 
drop down menu. Note that 
the index for the Options table 
starts at 0, not 1 like is common 
in most FusionScript tables. So, 
if you wish to set a default for 
the first entry in a list, you would 
use Default=0, for the second 
Default=1, and so on
Default (num)
A number specifying the index of the options table 
(below) to use as a default value for the drop down 
box when it is created.
Default (table {string, string, string…})
A table of strings describing the values displayed 
by the drop down box.
Multibutton Displays a Multibutton, 
where each option is drawn 
as a button.
The same options are used like 
in a Dropdown.
Default (num)
A number specifying the index of the options table 
(below) to use as a default value for the drop down 
box when it is created.
Options (table {string, string, string…})
A table of strings describing the values displayed 
as buttons.
This example shows a dialog that contains most of the various control types:
composition_path = composition:GetAttrs().COMPS_FileName

BezierSpline
class BezierSpline 
Parent class: Spline
Modifier that represents animation on a number value input.
Keyframes are interpolated with a bezier spline.
To animate Points use a Path instead.
> Python usage:
comp.Merge1.Blend= comp.BezierSpline()
comp.Merge1.Blend[1] = 1
comp.Merge1.Blend[50] = 0
> Lua usage:
Merge1.Blend = BezierSpline()
Merge1.Blend[1] = 1 -- Add keyframe at frame 1
Merge1.Blend[50] = 0 -- Add keyframe at frame 50
Methods
BezierSpline.AdjustKeyFrames (start, end, x, y, operation[, pivotx][, pivoty])
Set, Offset or Scale a range of key frames.
start, end Time range of keypoints to adjust (inclusive)
x, y Time and Value offsets/factors
operation Can be “set”, “offset” or “scale” (case sensitive)
pivotx, pivoty optional values to scale around. Default is zero.
> Parameters:
start (number) – start 
end (number) – end 
x (number) – x 
y (number) – y 
operation (string) – operation 
Reference
53
2 SCRIPTING REFERENCE
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
pivotx (number) – pivotx 
pivoty (number) – pivoty 
BezierSpline.DeleteKeyFrames(start[, end]) 
Delete key frames.
> Parameters:
start (number) – start 
end (number) – end 
BezierSpline.GetKeyFrames() 
Get a table of keyframes.
 While Operator:GetKeyFrames() returns a table of the tool’s valid extent, and 
Input:GetKeyFrames() returns a table of the keyframe times for any animation, when 
GetKeyFrames() is called from a BezierSpline modifier, it will return a table fully describing 
the spline’s curvature.
 The data returned consists of a table of subtables, one for each keyframe and with a key 
value of the keyframe’s time. The subtables contain an entry for the keyframe’s value, and 
optionally, subtables for the left and/or right handles, keyed by “LH” and “RH”. The handle 
subtables contain two entries, for the handle’s X & Y position.
Returns a table containing information about a spline control’s animation keyframes.
An example table for a spline with three keyframes follows:
{
[0.0] = { 2.0, RH = { 12.666667, 2.0 } },
[38.0] = { 3.86, LH = { 25.333333, 3.666667 }, RH = { 46.0, 4.0 } },
[62.0] = { 2.5, LH = { 54.0, 2.5 } }
}
> Python usage:
from pprint import pprint
# gets the spline output that is connected to the Blend input
splineout = comp.Merge1.Blend.GetConnectedOutput()
# then uses GetTool() to get the Bezier Spline modifier itself, and
54
2 SCRIPTING REFERENCE
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
if splineout:
spline = splineout.GetTool()
# then uses GetKeyFrames() to get a table of a spline data.
splinedata = spline.GetKeyFrames()
pprint(splinedata)
> Lua usage:
-- gets the spline output that is connected to the Blend input
splineout = Merge1.Blend:GetConnectedOutput()
-- then uses GetTool() to get the Bezier Spline modifier itself, and
if splineout then
 spline = splineout:GetTool()
-- then uses GetKeyFrames() to get a table of a spline data.
splinedata = spline:GetKeyFrames()
dump(splinedata)
end
> Returns: keyframes
> Return type: table
BezierSpline.SetKeyFrames(keyframes[, replace]) 
Set a table of keyframes.
 This function allows you to set a spline’s keyframes as well as its curvature. The table 
should consist of a table of subtables, one for each keyframe, each with a key value of the 
keyframe’s time. The subtables should contain an entry for the keyframe’s value, and may 
optionally contain subtables for the left and/or right handles, keyed by “LH” and “RH”. The 
handle subtables should contain two entries, for the handle’s X & Y position.
An example table for a spline with three keyframes follows:

Methods 
Composition.AbortRender() 
Stops any current rendering.
Composition.AbortRenderUI() 
Asks the user before aborting the render.
Composition.AddTool(id[, defsettings][, xpos][, ypos]) 
Adds a tool type at a specified position.
id the RegID of the tool to add.
defsettings specifies whether user-modified default settings should 
be applied for the new tool (true) or not (false, default).
xpos the X position of the tool in the flow view.
ypos the Y position of the tool in the flow view.
 You can use the number -32768 (the smallest negative value of a 16-bit integer) for both 
x and y position. This will cause Fusion to add the tool as if you had clicked on one of 
the toolbar icons. The tool will be positioned next to the currently selected one and a 
connection will automatically be made if possible. If no tool is selected then the last 
clicked position on the flow will be used. The same behaviour can be achieved with the 
comp:AddToolAction method.
Returns a tool handle that can be used to control the newly added tool.
> Python usage:
bg = comp.AddTool(“Background”, 1, 1)
mg = comp.AddTool(“Merge”, -32768, -32768)

Composition.AskRenderSettings() 
Show the Render Settings dialog.
Composition.AskUser(title, controls)
Present a custom dialog to the user, and return selected values.
 The AskUser function displays a dialog to the user, requesting input using a variety of 
common fusion controls such as sliders, menus and textboxes. All script execution stops 
until the user responds to the dialog by selecting OK or Cancel. This function can only be 
called interactively, command line scripts cannot use this function.
 The second argument of this function recieves a table of inputs describing which controls 
to display. Each entry in the table is another table describing the control and its options. 
For example, if you wanted to display a dialog that requested a path from a user, you might 
use the following script.
Returns a table containing the responses from the user, or nil if the user cancels the dialog.
Input Name (string, required)
 This name is the index value for the controls value as set by the user (i.e. dialog.Control or 
dialog[“Control Name”]). It is also the label shown next to the control in the dialog, unless 
the Name option is also provided for the control.
64
2 SCRIPTING REFERENCE
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Input Type (string, required)
 A string value describing the type of control to display. Valid strings are FileBrowse,PathBrowse, 
Position, Slider, Screw, Checkbox, Dropdown, and Text. Each Input type has its own 
properties and optional values, which are described below.
Options (misc)
 Different control types accept different options that determine how that control appears 
and behaves in the dialog.
AskUser Inputs
Input Type Description Options
Several of the Options are 
common to several controls. 
For example, the name 
option can be used with 
any type of control, and the 
DisplayedPrecision option 
can be used with any control 
that displays and returns 
numeric values.
Name (string) 
This option can be used to specify a more 
reasonable name for this inputs index in 
the returned table than the one used as a 
label for the control. 
Default (various) 
The default value displayed when the 
control is first shown.
Min (integer) 
Sets the minimum value allowed by the 
slider or screw control.
Max (numeric) 
Sets the maximum value allowed by the 
slider or screw control. 
DisplayedPrecision (numeric) 
Use this option to set how much precision 
is used for numeric controls like sliders, 
screws and position controls. A value 
of 2 would allow two decimal places of 
precision - i.e. 2.10 instead of 2.105
Integer (boolean) 
If true the slider or screw control will 
only allow integer (non decimal) values, 
otherwise the slider will provide full 
precision. Defaults to false if not specified.
FileBrowse
PathBrowse
ClipBrowse
The FileBrowse input allows 
you to browse to select a file on 
disk, while the PathBrowse input 
allows you to select a directory.
Save (boolean)
Set this option to true if the dialog is used 
to select a path or file which does not yet 
exist (i.e. when selecting a file to save to)

Input Type Description Options
Screw Displays the standard Fusion 
thumbwheel or screw control. 
This control is identical to a 
slider in almost all respects 
except that its range is infinite, 
and so it is well suited for 
angle controls and other values 
without practical limits.
Text Displays the Fusion textedit 
control, which is used to enter 
large amounts of Text into 
a control.
Lines (integer)
A number specifying how many lines of 
text to display in the control.
Wrap (boolean)
A true or false value that determines 
whether the text entered into this control 
will wrap to the next line when it reaches 
the end of the line.
ReadOnly (boolean)
If this option is set to true the control will 
not allow any editing of the text within the 
control. Use for displaying non-editable 
information.
FontName (string)
The name of a true type font to use when 
displaying text in this control.
FontSize (numeric)
A number specifying the font size used to 
display the text in this control.
Slider Displays a standard Fusion slider 
control. Labels can be set for the 
high and low ends of the slider 
using the following options.
LowName (string)
The text label used for the low (left) end of 
the slider.
HighName (string)
The text label used for the high (right) end 
of the slider.
66

FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Input Type Description Options
Checkbox Displays a Fusion standard 
checkbox control. You can 
display several of these controls 
next to each other using the 
NumAcross option.
Default (numeric)
The default state for the checkbox, use 0 
to leave the checkbox deselected, or 1 to 
enable the checkbox. Defaults to 0 if not 
specified.
NumAcross (numeric)
If the NumAcross value is set the dialog 
will reserve space to display two or 
more checkboxes next to each other. 
The NumAcross value must be set for 
all checkboxes to be displayed on the 
same row. See examples below for more 
information.
Position Displays a pair of edit boxes 
used to enter X & Y co-ordinates 
for a center control or other 
positional value. The default 
value for this control is a table 
with two values, one for the X 
value and one for the Y value. 
This control returns a table 
of values.
Default (table {x,y})
A table with two numeric entries 
specifying the value for the x and y 
co-ordinates.
Dropdown 
Multibutton
Displays the standard Fusion 
drop down menu for selecting 
from a list of options. This 
control exposes an option called 
Options which takes a table 
containing the values for the 
drop down menu. Note that 
the index for the Options table 
starts at 0, not 1 like is common 
in most tables. So if you wish to 
set a default for the first entry 
in a list, you would use Default 
= 0, for the second Default = 1, 
and so on.
Default (num)
A number specifying the index of the 
options table (below) to use as a default 
value for the drop down box when it 
is created.
Options (table {string, string, string,...})
A table of strings describing the values 
displayed by the drop down box.

> Parameters: 
path (string) – path
> Returns: ID
> Return type: string
Composition.ClearUndo() 
Clears the undo/redo history for the composition.
Composition.Close() 
 The Close function is used to close a composition. The Fusion Composition object that 
calls the function will then be set to nil.
 If the comp is in locked mode, then the Close function will not attempt to save the comp, 
whether the comp has been modified or not since its last save. If modifications have been 
made that should be kept, call the Save() function first.
 If the comp is unlocked, it will ask if the comp should be saved before closing.
Returns true if the composition was successfully closed, nil if the composition failed to close.

Composition.DisableSelectedTools() 
Pass-through the selected tools.
Composition.EndUndo(keep) 
 The StartUndo() function is always paired with an EndUndo() function. Any changes made 
to the composition by the lines of script between StartUndo() and EndUndo() are stored as 
a single Undo event.
 Changes captured in the undo event can be undone from the GUI using CTRL-Z, or the Edit 
menu. They can also be undone from script, by calling the Undo function. keep determines 
whether the captured undo event is to kept or discarded. Specifying ‘true’ results in the 
undo event being added to the undo stack, and appearing in the appropriate menu. 
Specifying ‘false’ will result in no undo event being created. This should be used sparingly, 
as the user (or script) will have no way to undo the preceding commands.
 If the script exits before the EndUndo() is called Fusion will automatically close the 
undo event.
> Python usage:
composition.StartUndo(“Add some tools”)
bg1 = comp.Background()
pl1 = comp.Plasma()
mg1 = comp.Merge({ “Background”: bg1, “Foreground”: pl1 })
composition.EndUndo(True)
> Lua usage:
composition:StartUndo(“Add some tools”)

Composition.GetData([name]) 
Get custom persistent data.
name name of the data. This name can be in “table.subtable” format, to allow persistent 
data to be stored within subtables.
 Persistent data is a very useful way to store names, dates, filenames, notes, flags, or anything 
else, in such a way that they are permanently associated with this instance of the object, 
and are stored along with the object using SetData(), and can be retrieved at any time with 
GetData().
 The method of storage varies by object: SetData() called on the Fusion app itself will 
save its data in the Fusion.prefs file, and will be available whenever that copy of Fusion is 
running. Calling SetData() on any object associated with a Composition will cause the data 
to be saved in the .comp file, or in any settings files that may be saved directly from that 
object. Some ephemeral objects that are not associated with any composition and are not 
otherwise saved in any way, may not have their data permanently stored at all, and the data 
will only persist as long as the object itself does.
 Returns a value that has been fetched from the object’s persistent data. It can be of 
almost any type.

This is equal to the state of COMPB_Rendering composition attribute.
> Returns: rendering
> Return type: boolean
Composition.Lock() 
Lock the composition from updating.
 The Lock() function sets a composition to non-interactive (“batch”, or locked) mode. This 
makes Fusion suppress any dialog boxes which may appear, and additionally prevents any 
re-rendering in response to changes to the controls. A locked composition can be unlocked 
with the Unlock() function, which returns the composition to interactive mode.
 It is often useful to surround a script with Lock() and Unlock(), especially when adding tools 
or modifying a composition. Doing this ensures Fusion won’t pop up a dialog to ask for user 
input, e.g. when adding a Loader, and can also speed up the operation of the script since 
no time will be spent rendering until the comp is unlocked.

Composition.MapPath(path) 
Expands path mappings in a path string.
 Retruns a file or directory path with all path maps expanded into their literal path 
equivalents.
81
2 SCRIPTING REFERENCE
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
 There are a number of default and user-specified path maps within Fusion that are intended 
to provide convenient ways to access common locations, or for flexibility in scripting. These 
can be any string, but often end in a colon, e.g. Fusion:, Comp:. They are expanded into a 
literal path as specified by the Path Maps preferences page.
 However, many Fusion functions (and all Lua functions) require strictly literal paths. MapPath() 
can be used to easily convert any path map into a fully-expanded literal path. If there is no 
path map at the beginning of the path, MapPath() will just return the unchanged path.
 In addition to expanding all global path maps like Fusion:MapPath(), Composition:MapPath() 
will also expand any path maps listed in the composition’s Path Map preferences, and the 
following built-in defaults.
For multiple directories use MapPathSegments().
> Python usage:
print(composition.MapPath(“Comp:footage\\file0000.tga”))
> Lua usage:
print(composition:MapPath(“Comp:footage\\file0000.tga”))
> Parameters:
path (string) – path
> Returns: mapped
> Return type: string
Composition.MapPathSegments(path) 
Expands all path mappings in a multipath.
 MapPathSegments is similar to MapPath but works with strings that contain multiple 
directories. The return value is a table with all expanded paths while MapPath only expands 
the first segment and discards the rest.
> Python usage:
from pprint import pprint
pprint(comp.MapPathSegments(“AllDocs:Settings;Fusion:Settings”))

Composition.Redo(count) 
Redo one or more changes to the composition.
The Redo function reverses the last undo event in Fusion.

Composition.ReverseMapPath(mapped) 
Collapses a path into best-matching path map.
 Whereas MapPath() is used to expand any Fusion path maps within a pathname to get an 
ordinary literal path, ReverseMapPath() will perform the opposite process, and re-insert 
those path maps.
 This is often useful if the path is to be stored for later usage (within a comp or script, for 
example). It allows the path to be used with the same meaning for another system or 
situation, where the literal location of the path may be different.
 In addition to handling all the global path maps like Fusion:ReverseMapPath(), 
Composition:ReverseMapPath() also handles any path maps listed in the composition’s 
Path Maps preferences page, as well as the built-in Comp: path map (see MapPath()).
Returns a path with the Fusion path map handles re-inserted wherever possible.

> Parameters:
mapped (string) – mapped
> Returns: path

Composition.RunScript(filename) 
Run a script within the composition’s script context.
 Use this function to run a script in the composition environment. This is similar to launching 
a script from the comp’s Scripts menu.
 The script will be started with ‘fusion’ and ‘composition’ variables set to the Fusion and 
currently active Composition objects. The filename given may be fully specified, or may be 
relative to the comp’s Scripts: path.
Fusion supports .py .py2 and .py3 extensions to differentiate python script versions.
> Parameters:
filename (string) – filename
Composition.Save(filename) 
Save the composition
 This function causes the composition to be saved to disk. The compname argument must 
specify a path relative to the filesystem of the Fusion which is saving the composition. In 
other words - if system ‘a’ is using the Save() function to instruct a Fusion on system ‘b’ to 
save a composition, the path provided must be valid from the perspective of system ‘b’.
filename is the complete path and name of the composition to be saved.
> Parameters:
filename (string) – filename
> Returns: success
> Return type: boolean
Composition.SaveAs() 
Prompt user with a Save As dialog box to save the composition.
Composition.SaveCopyAs() 
Prompt user with a Save As dialog box to save the composition as copy.
Composition.SetActiveTool(tool) 
Set the currently active tool.
 This function will set the currently active tool to one specified by script. It can be read with 
ActiveTool.
To deselect all tools, omit the parameter or use nil.
90
2 SCRIPTING REFERENCE
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
 Note that ActiveTool also means the tool is selected, while selected tools are not automativally 
Active. Only one tool can be Active at a time. To select tools use FlowView:Select().
> Parameters:
tool (Tool) – tool
Composition.SetData(name, value) 
Set custom persistent data.
name name of the data. This name can be in “table.subtable” format, to allow persistent 
data to be stored within subtables.
value to be recorded in the object’s persistent data. It can be of almost any type.
 Persistent data is a very useful way to store names, dates, filenames, notes, flags, or anything 
else, in such a way that they are permanently associated with this instance of the object, 
and are stored along with the object using SetData(), and can be retrieved at any time with 
GetData().
 The method of storage varies by object: SetData() called on the Fusion app itself will 
save its data in the Fusion.prefs file, and will be available whenever that copy of Fusion is 
running. Calling SetData() on any object associated with a Composition will cause the data 
to be saved in the .comp file, or in any settings files that may be saved directly from that 
object. Some ephemeral objects that are not associated with any composition and are not 
otherwise saved in any way, may not have their data permanently stored at all, and the data 
will only persist as long as the object itself does.
> Python usage:
from pprint import pprint
from datetime import datetime
tool = comp.ActiveTool
tool.SetData(“Modified.Author”, fusion.GetEnv(“USERNAME”))
tool.SetData(“Modified.Date”, str(datetime.now()))

Composition.SetPrefs(prefname, val) 
Note: This method is overloaded and has alternative parameters. See other definitions.
Set preferences from a table of attributes.
 The SetPrefs function can be used to specify the values of virtually all preferences in Fusion. 
Its can take a table of values, identified by name, or a single name and value.
 The table provided as an argument should have the format [prefs_name] = value. Subtables 
are allowed.
 It is possible to set a preference that does not exist. For example, setting fusion:SetPrefs 
({Comp.FrameFormat.Stuff = “Bob”}) will create a new preference which will be thereafter 
preserved in the Fusion preferences file.
 Returns false if any of the arguments provided to it are invalid, and true otherwise. Note 
that the function will still return true if an attempt is made to set a preference to an invalid 
value. For example, attempting to setting the FPS to “Bob” will fail, but the function will still 
return true.
> Python usage:
comp.SetPrefs({ “Comp.Transport.FrameStep”:5, “Comp.FrameFormat.AspectX”:2 })
comp.SetPrefs(“Comp.Interactive.BackgroundRender”, True)

Composition.StartUndo(name) 
Start an undo event.
 The StartUndo() function is always paired with an EndUndo() function. Any changes made 
to the composition by the lines of script between StartUndo() and EndUndo() are stored as 
a single Undo event.
 Changes captured in the undo event can be undone from the GUI using CTRL-Z, or the Edit 
menu. They can also be undone from script, by calling the Undo function.
 Should be used sparingly, as the user (or script) will have no way to undo the 
preceding commands.
name specifies the name displayed in the Edit/Undo menu of the Fusion GUI a string 
containing the complete path and name of the composition to be saved.
 Actual changes must be made to the composition (forcing a “dirty” event) before the undo 
will be added to the stack.

Composition.Stop() 
Stops interactive playback.
 Use this function in the same way that you would use the Stop button in the composition’s 
playback controls.
Composition.Undo(count) 
Undo one or more changes to the composition.
 The Undo function triggers an undo event in Fusion. The count argument determines how 
many undo events are triggered.
 Note that the value of count can be negative, in which case Undo will behave as a Redo, 
acting exactly as the Redo() function does.
count specifies how many undo events to trigger.
> Parameters:
count (number) – count
94
2 SCRIPTING REFERENCE
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
Composition.Unlock() 
Unlock the composition.
 The Unlock() function returns a composition to interactive mode. This allows Fusion to show 
dialog boxes to the user, and allows re-rendering in response to changes to the controls. 
Calling Unlock() will have no effect unless the composition has been locked with the Lock() 
function first.
 It is often useful to surround a script with Lock() and Unlock(), especially when adding tools 
or modifying a composition. Doing this ensures Fusion won’t pop up a dialog to ask for user 
input, e.g. when adding a Loader, and can also speed up the operation of the script since 
no time will be spent rendering until the comp is unlocked.
> Python usage:
comp.Lock()
# Will not open the file dialog, since the composition is locked
my_loader = comp.Loader()
comp.Unlock()
> Lua usage:
comp:Lock()
-- Will not open the file dialog, since the composition is locked

Fusion.GetRegAttrs(id[, type]) 
Retrieve information about a registry ID.
 The GetRegAttrs() function will return a table with the attributes of a specific individual 
registry entry in Fusion. The only argument is the ID, a unique numeric identifier possessed 
110
2 SCRIPTING REFERENCE
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
by each entry in the registry. The ID identifiers for each registry item can be obtained from 
fusion:GetRegList(), fusion:FindRegID(), and tool:GetID() functions.
Registry attributes are strictly read only, and cannot be modified in any way.
> Python usage:
from pprint import pprint
# Dump RegAttrs for the Active tool,
# or prints message if nothing is Active.
pprint(comp.ActiveTool and
fusion.GetRegAttrs(comp.ActiveTool.ID) or
“Please set an ActiveTool first.”)
> Lua usage:
-- Dump RegAttrs for the Active tool,
-- or prints message if nothing is Active.
dump(comp.ActiveTool and
fusion:GetRegAttrs(comp.ActiveTool.ID) or
“Please set an ActiveTool first.”)
> Parameters:
id (string) – id 
type (number) – type 
> Returns: attrs
> Return type: table
Fusion.GetRegList(typemask) 
Retrieve a list of all registry objects known to the system.
 The Fusion registry stores information about the configuration and capabilities of a 
particular installation of Fusion. Details like which file formats are supported, and which 
tools are installed are found in the registry. Note that this is NOT the same thing as the 
operating system registry, the registry accessed by this function is unique to Fusion.
111
2 SCRIPTING REFERENCE
FUSION SCRIPTING GUIDE AND REFERENCE MANUAL
 The only argument accepted by GetRegAttrs is a mask constant, which is used to filter the 
registry for specific registry types. The constants represent a particular type of registry 
entry, for example CT_Any will return all entries in the registry, while CT_Source will only 
return entries describing tools from the source category of tools (Loader, Plasma, Text...). A 
complete list of valid constants can be found here.
 Returns a table, which contains a list of the Numeric ID values for each registry entry. The 
numeric ID is constant from machine to machine, e.g. the numeric ID for the QuickTime 
format would be 1297371438, regardless of the installation or version of Fusion.
 These ID’s are used as arguments to the GetRegAttrs() function, which provides access to 
the actual values stored in the specific registry setting.
typemask a predefined constant that determines the type of registry entry returned by 
the function.
Some valid Mask constants:
CT_Tool all tools
CT_Mask mask tools only
 CT_SourceTool creator tools (images/3D/particles) all 
of which don’t require an input image
CT_ParticleTool Particle tools
CT_Modifier Modifiers
CT_ImageFormat ImageFormats
CT_View Different sections of the interface
CT_GLViewer All kinds of viewers
CT_PreviewControl PreviewControls in the viewer
CT_InputControl Input controls
CT_BinItem Bin items

Show a particular buffer.
 The SetBuffer function is used to display a specific one of the three possible view options 
for the A/B subviews in a view in Fusion. As stated above, 0 = the buffer view that the 
function is being run on, 1 = the buffer view that the function is not being run on, 2 = A/B 
view. So if the preview window that the function was being run on was the Left B view, the 
function would set the display viewer to B if the integer value was 0.
 buffer buffer integer that the view will be set to. Buffer 0 = The Buffer view that is the 
currently selected on, 1 = The buffer view that is not the current one, 2 = A/B.
> Python usage:
# Set the buffer to A/B with a 45 degree split at the center
left = comp.GetPreviewList()[“Left”][“View”]
